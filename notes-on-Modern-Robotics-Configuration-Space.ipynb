        "> A robot is mechanically constructed by connecting a set of bodies, called **links**, to each other using various types of **joints**. **Actuators**, such as electric motors, deliver forces or torques that cause the robot’s links to move. Usually an **end- effector**, such as a gripper or hand for grasping and manipulating objects, is attached to a specific link. _pg. 11_\n",

        "_Where_ the robot is, is given by its **configuration**: a specification of all points of the robot.\n",
        "\n",
        "> The number of **degrees of freedom (dof)** of a robot is the smallest number of real-valued coordinates needed to represent its configuration. _pg. 11_\n",
        "\n",
        ">The **configuration** of a robot is a complete specification of the position of every point of the robot. The minimum number n of real-valued coordinates needed to represent the configuration is the number of **degrees of freedom (dof**) of the robot. The n-dimensional space containing all possible configurations of the robot is called the **configuration space (C-space)**. The configuration of a robot is represented by a point in its C-space. _pg. 12_\n",
        "\n",
        "The C-space of a robot's end-effector is called the **task space**.\n",

        "A rigid body in $n$-dimensional space has $m$ total degrees of freedom, $n(n−1)/2$ of which, are angular.\n",
        "\n",
        "The configuration of a rigid body in 2D space can be described with three points, `A`, `B`, and `C`. Each of these points have a fixed distance between them, _(because the body is rigid)_. \n",
        "\n",
        "We can represent those three points using 2D coordinates: `(xA, yA)`, `(xB, yB)`, and `(xC, yC)`. If these points were all independent, the rigid body would have six degrees of freedom! However, there are three constraints on the body, the distances between the points: `dAB`, `dBC`, and `dCA`.\n",
        "\n",
        "To determine the total degrees of freedom, we start with point `A`, which has two degrees of freedom, `(xA, yA)`, because we can choose any point we want. Then we move to point `B`, which would also have two degrees of freedom, but is constrained by the constant `d(A,B) = dAB`. \n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://thomascountz.com/assets/PlanarRidgidBodyConfiguration.jpg\" width=\"750px\">\n",
        "\n",
        "Because of this constraint, point `B` has to fall on the circle with a radius of `dAB` and which is centered at point `A`. This means that we can describe point `B` as a function of the constant `dAB` and an angle, $\\theta$.\n",
        "\n",
        ">Once we have chosen the location of point `B`, there are only two possible locations for C: at the intersections of the circle of radius `dAC` centered at `A` and the circle of radius `dBC` centered at `B`. _pg. 14_\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2D space, we cannot \"flip\" a rigid body, or \"rotate\" about the `x`- and `y`- axis, so once we select a position for `C`, it's relative position to `A` and `B` cannot be changed. This means that the constraints of `d(A,C) = dAC` and `d(B,C) = dBC` \"cancel out\" the freedoms of `(xC, yC)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2D space, we can describe this configuration of a rigid body, called a **planar rigid body**, with three variables: _(x, y, $\\theta$)_. Where `x` and `y` represent the position and $\\theta$ represents the angle, often relative to the `x`-axis. Because we can describe the configuration with three real-valued coordinates, we say that a **planar rigid body as three degrees of freedom**.\n",
        "\n",
        "> This general rule can also be used to determine the number of freedoms of a rigid body in three dimensions. For example, assume our \\[2D rigid body\\] is no longer confined to \\[a 2D plane\\]. The coordinates for the three points `A`, `B`, and `C` are now given by `(xA,yA,zA)`, `(xB,yB,zB)`, and `(xC,yC,zC)`, respectively. Point `A` can be placed freely (three degrees of freedom). The location of point `B` is subject to the constraint `d(A,B) = dAB`, meaning it must lie on the sphere of radius `dAB` centered at `A`. Thus we have `3 − 1 = 2` freedoms to specify, which can be expressed as the latitude and longitude for the point on the sphere. Finally, the location of point `C` must lie at the intersection of spheres centered at `A` and `B` of radius `dAC` and `dBC`, respectively. In the general case the intersection of two spheres is a circle, and the location of point C can be described by an angle that parametrizes this circle. Point `C` therefore adds `3 − 2 = 1` freedom. Once the position of point `C` is chosen, the \\[3D rigid body\\] is fixed in space. _pg. 14_\n",
        "\n",
        "In 3D space, we can describe the configuration of a rigid body, called a **spatial rigid body**, with six variables: three coordinates parametrizing point `A`, the latitude and longitude parametrizing point `B`, and one angle parametrizing point `C`, provided `A`, `B`, and `C` are non-collinear.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since our robots consist of rigid bodies, can be expressed as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        " DoF = (sum of freedoms of the bodies) − (number of independent constraints).\n",

        "### Robot Joints & DoF\n",
        "\n",
        "**Open-chain** robots have a single path from the ground to the end-effector. This is opposed to **closed-chain** robots, which have at least two connection to ground.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider a door on a hinge. A door is a spatial rigid body, so it should have six degrees of freedom. However, the hinge joint imposes five independent constraints, so the door only has one, which can be described by the angle ($\\theta$).\n",
        "\n",
        "The door's C-space is represented by the range $[ 0, 2\\pi ]$, over which $\\theta$ can vary.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can use this observation to deduce a relationship between a robot's degrees of freedom and its number of joints and rigid bodies. This relationship can be expressed using **Grübler’s formula**.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Joints\n",
        "\n",
        "Every join connects exactly two links, any joint that connects more than two links is not allowed. \n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some common joints:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The **revolute joint** (R), also called a hinge joint, allows rotational motion about the joint axis. This joint has one degree of freedom.\n",
        "* The **prismatic joint** (P), also called a sliding or linear joint, allows translational (or rectilinear) motion along the direction of the joint axis. This joint has one degree of freedom.\n",
        "* The **helical joint** (H), also called a screw joint, allows simultaneous rotation and translation about a screw axis. This joint has one degree of freedom.\n",
        "* The **cylindrical joint** (C) has two degrees of freedom and allows independent translations and rotations about a single fixed joint axis. \n",
        "* The **universal join**t (U) is another two-degree- of-freedom joint that consists of a pair of revolute joints arranged so that their joint axes are orthogonal. \n",
        "* The **spherical joint** (S), also called a ball-and-socket joint, has three degrees of freedom and functions much like our shoulder joint.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Grübler's Formula\n",
        "\n",
        "Joints can be thought as either providing *freedoms* to allow a rigid body to move relative to another, or as providing *constraints* to the possible freedoms of the two rigid bodies that it connects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, taking the number of possible freedoms of a rigid body, (three for planar, six for planar), and subtracting the number of constraints a joint provides those two bodies, will end up equaling the number of freedoms that the joint provided by the joint.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, a revolute joint in 2D space provides two constraints, meaning that the DoF for two rigid bodies connected by a revolute joint is one.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        ">Consider a mechanism consisting of $N$ links, where ground is also regarded as a link. Let $J$ be the number of joints, $m$ be the number of degrees of freedom of a rigid body ($m = 3$ for planar mechanisms and $m = 6$ for spatial mechanisms), $f_i$ be the number of freedoms provided by joint $i$, and $c_i$ be the number of constraints provided by joint $i$, where $f_i + c_i = m$ for all $i$. -_pg. 17_\n",
